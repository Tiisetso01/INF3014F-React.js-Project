        A Xhosa person is introduced to the culture of tobacco from birth to death, such that when someone passes away it is sometimes said that Inqawe uyibakile – ‘they have laid down their pipe’.
        Beads were used to decorate clothing & other objects of value.

        368 grams - 7.5cm wide x 4.5cm high (when lying on it's side)

        Much mystery surrounds the creation and use of bored/perforated stones by the Khoisan, and how they could have been made.  Bored stones were used as weights on digging sticks by women and also had religious significance.  There is no distinction in Khoisan culture between utilitarian objects and spiritual, so most likely had a dual function.
        
        There is some evidence to suggest that to Khoisan shamans, they could have represented a portal to the underworld and were used in rituals where shamans attempted to connect with spirits or in an attempt to influence the weather.
        
        There are many theories surrounding them, how they could have been made, who made them and what they were used for.  Some have suggested that the Khoisan didn't have the technology to create them and that they were perhaps found items that they then used and handed down through the generations.  This has been disputed though and methods have been proposed to explain how they could have been made using locally available stone & quartz tools.  
        
        To anyone interested in history and archaeology, this is something fascinating to own and to treasure.
